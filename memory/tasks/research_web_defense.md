# Task: Researching Defensive Strategies for Web Attacks

## Goal
To understand and document defensive strategies against common web vulnerabilities.

## Objective
1. Identifying common web attack vectors (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, SSRF).
2. Researching and documenting corresponding defense mechanisms and best practices.
3. Investigating how to set up a simulated environment for practicing offense-defense scenarios using Docker/VMs.

## Action Items
1. **Analyze Common Web Vulnerabilities**: List and define the most prevalent web attack types.
2. **Document Defense Mechanisms**: For each vulnerability, detail the primary defense strategies (e.g., input validation, output encoding, secure session management).
3. **Research Lab Setup**: Explore resources on setting up practical offense-defense labs using Docker and VMs (e.g., OWASP Juice Shop, DVWA).
4. **Synthesize Findings**: Compile a report summarizing defensive strategies and lab setup guides.
